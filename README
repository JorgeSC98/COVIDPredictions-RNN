COVID-19 has been a situation that has generated tons of data every day from infections to vaccination rates worldwide. 
This paper will present the preprocessing, classification, and comparison of three different RNN architectures applied to
a COVID-19 dataset from Mexico in order to predict death cases over months, providing the best hyperparameters found for 
each model.

All details are embedded in the main colab project. 
The database file "owid-covid-data" can be found on the file database as a link.
 In order to make changes or modify the main database, you need to change the path and the filename when importing the database, if is mounted to google drive.
